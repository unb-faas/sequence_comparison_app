[Growth inhibitory effect of microRNA-519b-3p on larynx squamous Hep-2 cells].
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of microRNA-519b-3p (miR-519b-3p) on laryngeal carcinoma Hep-2 cell growth, and to analyze the underlying molecular mechanisms.
METHODS: The effects of miR-519b-3p on the growth and cell cycle of Hep-2 cells transfected with miR-519b-3p mimic were tested by MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively.
The mRNA and protein expressions of the related genes were tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot, respectively.
The expressions of miR-519b-3p were tested by real-time RT-PCR in 48 pairs of laryngeal carcinoma and adjacent tissue samples.
RESULTS: The expression of miR-519b-3p in laryngeal carcinoma tissues was significant lower than that in adjacent non-cancerous tissues (S (DeltaCt) = 2.989, t = 2. 693, P < 0. 01).
Increasing the level of miR-519b-3p inhibited significantly Hep-2 cell proliferation, arrested the cell cycle in the G2/M phase (10.29 % +/- 4. 63 %, t = 4. 395, P < 0. 05), and decreased significantly the percentage of cells in the S phase (7.56 % +/- 2. 05 %, t = 3. 555, P < 0. 05), with the increase in the expression of cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 1 and the decrease in the expressions of CDK 2 and Cyclin A. RT-PCR and Western blot showed that miR-519b-3p down-regulated the protein but not mRNA expressions of HuR and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) genes.
CONCLUSIONS: The expression of MiR-519b-3p as carcinoma suppressor gene is low in laryngeal carcinoma.
The cell cycle of Hep-2 cells was arrested in the G2/M phase by MiR-519b-3p.
